1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm still a fan even though I was salty

2
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,620
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,260
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,600
I'm so mature, I'm so mature

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,740
I'm so mature, I'm so mature

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,100
I'm so mature.

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,980
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,140
I don't want none, I just want you

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,820
If I can't have you, no one should

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,719
I might

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,039
Not the best idea (idea)

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,439
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?

13
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,460
I might kill my ex, not the best idea

14
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,019
I still love him though (I do)

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,140
Rather be in jail than alone

16
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:57,480
I get the sense that it's a lost cause

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,980
I get the sense that you might really love her

18
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,159
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence

19
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,439
The sex is evidence.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crimes of passion, but damn

21
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,659
Now I'm in the basement, planning home invasion

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,120
But damn.

23
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,620
You was out of reach

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,819
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach

25
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,819
Now I'm in the basement.

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Planting on my beige.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,540
Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat

28
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,219
Got me saying all about a piece.

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
I'm so mature.

30
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,379
I'm so mature.

31
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,659
I'm so mature.

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
I don't want none, I just want you

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,700
If I can't have you, no one will

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
I might kill my ex, not the best idea

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
I might get my ex.

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
Not the best idea.

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
How'd I get here?

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
I just killed my ex (my ex)

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
I might kill my ex, I still love him though

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Rather be in jail than alone

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
I did it all for love (love)

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
I did it all on no drugs (drugs)

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
I did all of this sober

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
I did it all for us, oh

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
I did it all for love (love)

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
I did all of this sober

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
I did all of this on no drugs (drugs)

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
I did it all for us all.

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
I did it all for us all.

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
I did it all for love.

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
I did it all on no drugs.

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,840
I did it all for us all.

55
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
I did it all for us all.

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I did it all for us all.

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
I did it all for us all.

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Not the best idea.

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here? (He left me no choice)

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
How'd I get here?

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
I just killed my ex.

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
I might kill my ex, I still love him though

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Rather be in Hell than alone

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
I did it all for love.

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
I did it all for us all.

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
I did it all for us all.

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
I did it all for us all.
